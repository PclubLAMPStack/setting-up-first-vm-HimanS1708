Steps - 

1. Downloaded VMware to run the iso file of the OS.
2. Instead of removing the GUI completely, I just set up the **grub** to stop the **GUI** from loading on boot and instead give us the text login, so that I could restore it later if required.

    Command -
    ```
    systemctl set-default multi-user.target
    ```
    
3. Then we get ```Command Line Interface (CLI)``` on rebooting.


**A hacky solution** - We can also download the iso of minimal CentOS-7 directly. It contains only the CLI and no GUI.
